= Versions =
A list of features that must be implemented before each version is tagged.  This should serve as a structure for coding the project.

  * 0.0:
    * This is the first commit, which is not usable.  It just indicates placement of some basic code structure in SVN.
  * 0.1:
    * Program should run without errors
    * A default "page" should appear on startup, with staves
    * A simple classifier should be implemented, recognizing noteheads, vertical lines, and categorizing everything else as "unknown".
    * Noteheads should be recognized when drawn, and attached to the appropriate staves
    * Barlines should be recognized when drawn, and attached to the appropriate staves
    * Vertical lines should be recognized and attached to single notes when appropriate
  * 0.2:
    * The basic code structure should be cemented
    * Support for multi-segment gestures should be implemented
    * Basic accidentals should be recognized and attached to appropriate notes
  * 0.3:
    * TBD
