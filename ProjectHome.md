The goal of StaffPad is to allow tablet PC users to have a simple, fast interface for sheet music input.  It is not intended (at least at this point) to be a full-featured music notation program, but rather a program that emulates a sheet of staff paper.  The program will recognize basic musical elements (notes, barlines, accidentals, clefs, slurs, etc) that are drawn onto the virtual staff paper.  Future goals include the ability to export the written music into a format that is usable by more powerful notation and formatting programs, with the idea that this program will be a first step in entering music fast, easily, and naturally, without a cumbersome interface.
